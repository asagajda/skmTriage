		Only if a context file does not exist for the application in 
		the $CATALINA_HOME/conf/[enginename]/[hostname]/;
		If the web application is packaged as a WAR then this
		file will be automatically copied to 
		$CATALINA_HOME/conf/[enginename]/[hostname]/ and renamed 
		to match the application's context path. Once this file exists, 
		it will not be replaced if a new WAR with a newer /META-INF/context.xml
		is placed in the host's appBase.
		
		Once this file is located in $CATALINA_HOME/conf/[enginename]/[hostname]/
		(either automatically during WAR expansion or manually during deployment)
		The parameters defined here can be modified to match your configuration and
		will not be override if a newer WAR is deployed.
